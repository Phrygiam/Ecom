Basically, we create the Screens folder in which we create a component named HomeScreen.
In this component, we will gather the database products and render them into another
component named Products, in which we pass the prop "product"
(which is the database product object we gathered)

Additionally, we create the ProductScreen component which will render the product page of the 
selected item through React Router
